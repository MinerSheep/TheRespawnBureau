When you are working on a scene, make sure that no one else is working on it!

If you attempt to save a scene and someone else is working on it, you should get an error.

Sometimes you will need to work in a scene because certain assets are needed, that is fine.

But if you are making a new mechanic, it's best to make it in a new scene and use the player prefab
(Because then you won't lock down the scene for others!)
